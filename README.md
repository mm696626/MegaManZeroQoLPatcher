# MegaManZeroQoLPatcher

### Mega Man Zero Series Quality of Life Patcher
* A tool to modify the Mega Man Zero games with various Quality of Life (QoL) tweaks such as reducing weapon requirements or making EX skills not require A rank or higher

### Setup to get this tool working
* Have one of the following ROMs
  * Megaman Zero (USA, Europe)
  * Megaman Zero 2 (USA)
  * Megaman Zero 3 (USA)
  * Megaman Zero 4 (USA)
* Navigate to the game you'd like to patch and select the ROM
